# HackathonCameroon2022

Over the last 10 years, Cameroon started a process of decentralization: provinces have been changed into Regions, and senators has been established across the country. In 2019, the Government instituted “the general code of regional and local authorities” empowering the localities of each big town of Cameroon: regional councils and presidents of the region have been elected. In 2021, common decentralisation funds have been distributed for 2022. In a decree, the president of the republic of Cameroon transfered URBANISATION AND HOUSING competences to local authorities, giving them more power and budget to master local territorial developments. This unprecendented opportunity comes with economical growth and finantial autonomisation challenges to solve. 

In order to address these issues, the National Business Incubator of Cameroon has been built in Edea. The place is in charge for training staffs of local authorities and city councils, as well as growing the seeds of the next generation of innovative entreprises of the country. This year it collaborates with an internation team of urbanists traveling the African continent under the name of "Traveling Circus of Urbanism" with the objective to solve precisely local urban challenges faced by Cameroonian municipalities. 

Hackathon Cameroon 2022 is the opening event of this collaboration, allowing us to detect the most promising teams and ideas willing to shape the Cameroonian startup ecosystem of tomorrow. Participants will benefit the most valuable mentoring of international experts on the topic, and shape the better solutions to the crucial issues faced by our cities nowadays. The winners of the hackathon will be integrated to a 4-Months program of the National Business Incubator where they will receive support to go from prototype to MVP, find their market-fit, and start their business development.
