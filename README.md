African urbanization data at country and agglomeration levels, from 1950 to 2015. 

*Country level:
Total number of people living in urban agglomerations.
Share of the urban population in total population.
Total number of urban agglomerations in country.
Share of metropolitan population in total urban population.
Average distance (straight-line) between all pairs of agglomerations in the country.
Share of the country’s total land area covered by the total built-up area of urban agglomerations.
Total number of people living in country.
Total land area in square kilometre.

*City level (agglomerations above 100 000 inhabitants)
Number of inhabitants living in the agglomeration.
Number of inhabitants per square kilometre. 
Surface of built-up area in square kilometres.
Distance (straight-line) to nearest metropolitan agglomeration in kilometres. 
Name of corresponding metropolitan agglomeration.
Size of the agglomeration’s Voronoi cell in square kilometres.

Outlines of buildings derived from high-resolution satellite imagery. 

*Building polygons
Latitude of the building polygon centroid.
Longitude of the building polygon centroid.
Area in square meters of the polygon.
Confidence score [0.5;1.0] assigned by the model.
Polygon in the WKT format (POLYGON or MULTIPOLYGON).
Plus Code at the building polygon centroid.

Can be used for population estimation, urban planning, humanitarian response, environmental and climate science. Population mapping, estimating population density can be useful for understanding human impact on the natural environment, estimating energy needs and carbon emissions, but also in epidemiology to anticipate demand for vaccines and the best locations for facilities. Assess the number of buildings or households affected by flood, drought, or other natural disaster. Also building footprints can help with the rollout of digital addressing systems, in order to access social benefits and economic opportunities. Knowing the numbers of houses in the catchment areas of schools and health centres, mean travel distances to the nearest hospital or forecast of demand for transportation systems.
