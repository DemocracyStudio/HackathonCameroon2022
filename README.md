## Datasets

- Africapolis, 2020, updated 2021. SWAC/OCDE. https://africapolis.org/.  
African urbanization data at country and agglomeration levels, from 1950 to 2015. 

*Country level:
Total number of people living in urban agglomerations.
Share of the urban population in total population.
Total number of urban agglomerations in country.
Share of metropolitan population in total urban population.
Average distance (straight-line) between all pairs of agglomerations in the country.
Share of the country’s total land area covered by the total built-up area of urban agglomerations.
Total number of people living in country.
Total land area in square kilometre.

*City level (agglomerations above 100 000 inhabitants)
Number of inhabitants living in the agglomeration.
Number of inhabitants per square kilometre. 
Surface of built-up area in square kilometres.
Distance (straight-line) to nearest metropolitan agglomeration in kilometres. 
Name of corresponding metropolitan agglomeration.
Size of the agglomeration’s Voronoi cell in square kilometres.

Can be used to visualize urban growth, new urban areas, migrations of population, population estimation and density. Evaluate the needs for urban services and regulation, infrastructures... Country level will help with continental analysis and 

- LandCoverNet, 2020. Radiant Earth foundation. https://mlhub.earth/data/landcovernet_v1
Land cover classification dataset across Africa, with labels for the multi-spectral satellite imagery from Sentinel-2 mission. There are seven land cover classes, based on its annual time series: water, natural bare ground, artificial bare ground, woody vegetation, cultivated vegetation, (semi) natural vegetation, and permanent snow/ice.

Can be used for calculation of needs in specific areas, in terms of mechanic engineering, chemical products, evaluating agricultural production... Using machine learning or not.
